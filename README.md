about the dataset:
The majority of the transactions are normally legitimate and only a small fraction are non-legitimate. Thus, typically you have access to a dataset that is highly unbalanced. This is also the case of the current dataset: only 492 transactions out of 284,807 are fraudulent (the positive class - the frauds - accounts for 0.172% of all transactions).
